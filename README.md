. Create a GitHub Repository
Sign in to your GitHub account.
Create a new repository:
Click the "+" icon at the top right of the GitHub page and select "New repository".
Give your repository a name (e.g., pygame-pacman-ai).
Optionally, add a description.
Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
Optionally, initialize the repository with a README file (you can add this later too).
Click "Create repository".
2. Set Up Git on Your Local Machine
If you haven't already, you'll need to install Git on your computer and set up your GitHub account. Follow these steps:

Install Git:

Windows: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
macOS: Use Homebrew: brew install git.
Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., sudo apt-get install git on Ubuntu.
Set Up Git:

Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
Set your GitHub username: git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Set your GitHub email: git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
3. Push Your Pygame Project to GitHub
Navigate to Your Project Directory:

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Pygame project is located:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Initialize a Git Repository:

Run the following command to initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
bash
Copy code
git init
Add Your Files:

Add your project files to the staging area:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit Your Files:

Commit the files with a message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Add the Remote Repository:

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you created:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the name of your repository.
Push Your Code to GitHub:

Push the code to the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
4. Verify Your Repository on GitHub
Go to your repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name).
You should see your Pygame project files listed in the repository.
5. Add a README (Optional)
Create a README.md file in your project directory to explain what your project is about, how to run it, and any other relevant information.
Add, commit, and push the README.md file to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README"
git push
6. Optional: Add a .gitignore File
Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files (like compiled .pyc files) from being tracked by Git:
bash
Copy code
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
Add, commit, and push the .gitignore file to GitHub.
7. Updating Your Project
Whenever you make changes to your project, follow these steps to update your repository:

Stage the changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
Push the changes:

bash
Copy code
git push
Summary
Create a GitHub repository.
Initialize a Git repository locally.
Add, commit, and push your files to GitHub.
Regularly update your repository with new changes.

# Pygame Pacman with AI

This project is a simple Pacman game developed using Python and Pygame. The game features an AI that controls the ghosts and offers an optional AI mode for Pacman. The game can be played manually or with the AI taking control of Pacman.

## Features

- **Classic Pacman Gameplay:** Navigate through the maze, eating pellets while avoiding ghosts.
- **Power Pellets:** Temporarily turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for bonus points.
- **AI-Controlled Ghosts:** The ghosts use the A* pathfinding algorithm to chase or run away from Pacman.
- **Optional AI for Pacman:** Toggle AI control for Pacman using the spacebar.
- **Multiple Levels:** Advance through levels with increasing difficulty.

## Gameplay

- **Controls:**
  - **WASD** or **Arrow keys**: Move Pacman manually.
  - **Spacebar**: Toggle AI control for Pacman on and off.
- **Objective:**
  - Eat all the pellets in the maze to advance to the next level.
  - Avoid the ghosts unless you've eaten a power pellet, which allows you to eat the ghosts for extra points.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installing Pygame

If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
Running the Game
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pygame-pacman-ai.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd pygame-pacman-ai
Run the game:

bash
Copy code
python pacman.py
How the AI Works
Ghosts
The ghosts use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path to Pacman.
When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts run away from Pacman.
Pacman AI
When AI mode is enabled, Pacman automatically navigates the maze, prioritizing pellets and avoiding ghosts.
Future Improvements
Add more maze layouts.
Implement additional ghost behaviors.
Enhance the AI for both Pacman and the ghosts.
